## Data Transformation
In the data transformation phase, we will be processing our data using two different Spark Notebooks to transform extracted data from CoinMarketCap API and Google CSE API respectively.

#### Data Transformation For Crypto Data
This is done using Synapse Data Engineering Component of Fabric.
- On the bottom left, click on the Power BI icon or whatever icon present there.
- From the list of icons, choose Synapse Data Engineering. 
- In Synapse Data Engineering environment, click on "Notebook" tab,-To create a Spark Notebook to "transform" the raw json file into a clean data table.
- On the top-left, click on the Notebook name and rename appropriately for easy referencing.
Step 1.
Use the created Notebook to import and read the raw json file that exist in stored Lakehouse Database.
- On the Left, click on "Lakehouse" button.
- On the left, click "Add Lakehouse" button.- This help in accessing the different tables and files that reside in the Lakehouse Database directly from the Notebook.
- Choose "Existing Lakehouse".
- Click "Add".
- Check or choose the Lakehouse where the raw json data resides.
- Click "Add".
- From the imported Lakehouse Database to the left, click on "File " (-This shows all files that reside in the Lakehouse Database),then "..." , then "Load Data" 
- There are two options (Spark or Pandas), Choose "Spark". 
A code is automatically generated to read the raw json file as a Pyspark DataFrame.

```

df = spark.read.option("multiline", "true").json("Files/crypto_data.json")
# df now is a Spark DataFrame containing JSON data from "Files/crypto_data.json".
display(df)

```

```
# To check Schema, data type of each column and if the data is nested or in array or  not
df.printSchema()

```

```

from pyspark.sql.functions import explode, col

# Explode the 'data' array to get individual records
exploded_df = df.select(explode(col('data')).alias('data'))

```

```
# Define the list of cryptocurrencies to extract from the list of 35 crypto currencies.
cryptos_to_extract = ['Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'Tether USDt', 'BNB', 'Solana', 'Dogecoin', 'USDC', 'XRP', 'Toncoin', 'TRON', 'Cardano', 'Avalanche']

# Filter and select the required fields
filtered_df = exploded_df.select(
    col('data.name').alias('Name'),
    col('data.symbol').alias('Symbol'),
    col('data.quote.USD.price').alias('Price'),
    col('data.quote.USD.market_cap').alias('Market Cap'),
    col('data.quote.USD.volume_24h').alias('Volume (24h)'),

    col('data.quote.USD.fully_diluted_market_cap').alias('Fully Diluted Market Cap'),
    col('data.last_updated').alias('Last Updated')
).filter(col('Name').isin(*cryptos_to_extract))

# Display the filtered data
filtered_df.show(truncate=False)

```

```
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Rename columns in DataFrame to match the Delta table schema to improve code readability, consistency, reliability and robustness
renamed_df = filtered_df.select(
    col('Name').alias('name'),
    col('Symbol').alias('symbol'),
    col('Price').alias('price'),
    col('Market Cap').alias('market_cap'),
    col('Volume (24h)').alias('volume_24h'),
    col('Percent Change (24h)').alias('percent_change_24h'),
    col('Circulating Supply').alias('circulating_supply'),
    col('Total Supply').alias('total_supply'),
    col('Fully Diluted Market Cap').alias('fully_diluted_market_cap'),
    col('Last Updated').alias('last_updated')
)

#### Data Transformation For Crypto News & Opinions
```
df = spark.read.option("multiline", "true").json("Files/crypto1-news-opinion.json")
# df now is a Spark DataFrame containing JSON data from "Files/crypto1-news-opinion.json".
display(df)
```

```
#Select the items column where the nested data is and ignore the other columns.

df = df.select(["items"])

```

```
from pyspark.sql.functions import explode

# Explode json object(items) as an alias(json_object)

df_exploded = df.select(explode(df["items"]).alias("json_object"))

```

```

display(df_exploded)

```

```

# Converting the Exploded Json Dataframe to a single Json string list,i.e. "json_list" variable

json_list = df_exploded.toJSON().collect()

```

```
#Testing the JSON string,by fetching all the 10 json object and see their json structure

print(json_list)

```

```
# Fectching just one of the json object to view its json structure

print(json_list[0])
```
```
"""
We need to process these JSON structures to extract the desired information 
and create a clean table format. However, since the output is a string, it presents challenges in retrieving the necessary data. 
To extract the information, we would need to write regular expressions and other processing steps because it is a string.
 To simplify this process, we should convert the JSON string into a JSON dictionary, making it much easier to access all or selected information.
 For that, we will be using this function <json.loads>

#### Handling Incrementa Loading For Crypto News & Opinions

To capture new, updated and unchanged News items and opinions on the US election , we will be employing incremental loading to our dataset using Slowly Changing Dimension Type_1. i.e SCD1. SCD Type1 is a form of incremental load technique in which new records are captured and updated records are overwritten and old records dropped and unchanged records remained unchanged.In SCD1 the table will always hold the present values and not the previous values. It does not keep historical records rather present records. This is good for sentiment analysis, where focus is on present perspectives and not comparison between historical and present perspectives.

# Removing timestamp from the last_updated columnimport pyspark.sql.functions as F

# Assuming your DataFrame is named 'df' and the column containing the timestamp is 'last_updated'
df = df.withColumn(
    "Date",
    F.to_date(F.col("last_updated"))
)

```

```
display(df)

```

```
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, to_date

# Drop the 'last_updated' column, so that we won't have duplicate date columns
df = df.drop("last_updated").drop("symbol")

# Convert the 'Date' column from string to date format
df_crypto_data = df.withColumn("Date", to_date(col("Date"), "yyyy-MM-dd"))

## Power BI Report

### Semantic Model
In order to utilize our data in creating  Crypto report in Power BI, we need to create a Semantic Model. Semantic Model is an advance Entity Relation Diagram of Business intelligence which leverage on the relationship between the Crypto Data table and Crypto Sentiment Table. In building the Semantic Model, we will be using the crypto data table and the crypto  sentiments table.

Steps:
- Go to Lakehouse Database
- At the top left, click on "New Semantic Model"
- Under (Direct Lake Semantic Model Name),Give name to your Semantic Model.
- Under "workspace" Choose the appropriate Workspace where the Data Model is to be created
- Scroll down, select the 2 table(s) you want to include the semantic model, i.e. "sentiments" and "table_cleaned_data" tables, then click (Confirm) to create your Semantic Model.

##### Data Model Image


![Screenshot 2024-09-19 221011](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5c2a8b9-489c-4ea1-9e3f-212f3f584d33)


##### Using Semantic Model To Build Power BI Report

Move back to your workspace.
- In your workspace, you will see the drop-down of all the resources you have created in your workspace.
- select the Semantic Model.
- At the top, under "Discover Business Insights", click on the drop-down arrow on "Explore this Data"--> choose "Auto Create Report" option. Power BI automatically generates a report base on data in Your Semantic Model
##### Let's further build on the  Auto Created Report by drilling down on the data in your Semantic Model to build a dynamic report.
- Click on "Edit" tab at the top. Then, continue.
- At the bottom of the page, click on "+" to create a blank new page for our visuals.
- At the top of the New Page, click on "Open Data Model"
Let us create new Measures for  our Report using DAX to further analyze the Crypto Market. The DAX you would be creating shall be on "Sentiments Table" ("Positive sentiments", "Negative Sentiments" and "Neutral Sentiments") and Crypto Metric Table ("3 Days Moving Average", "Price Change 24h", "Total Market Cap" of all the 12 selected Cryptocurrencies and "Total Market Dominance" of each crypto currency, i.e. market share of each currency .

### Data Analysis Expression on Crypto News Sentiments.
##### Steps:
- In your Semantic Model window, right click on the three dots "..." on your sentiments table.
- From the dropdown, click on "New Measure"
- Then, input the following DAX script for each of the measures and save
Negative Sentiment:
```
Negative Sentiment % = 
IF (
    COUNTROWS (FILTER ( 'sentiments', 'sentiments'[sentiment] = "negative" )) > 0,
    DIVIDE (
        CALCULATE (
            COUNTROWS(FILTER ( 'sentiments', 'sentiments'[sentiment] = "negative" ))
        ),
        COUNTROWS('sentiments')
    )*100,
    0
)

```
Positive Sentiment:

```
Positive Sentiment % = 
IF (
    COUNTROWS (FILTER ( 'sentiments', 'sentiments'[sentiment] = "positive" )) > 0,
    DIVIDE (
        CALCULATE (
            COUNTROWS(FILTER ( 'sentiments', 'sentiments'[sentiment] = "positive" ))
        ),
        COUNTROWS('sentiments')
    )*100,
    0
)

```
Neutral Sentiments:

```
Neutral Sentiment % = 
IF (
    COUNTROWS (FILTER ( 'sentiments', 'sentiments'[sentiment] = "neutral" )) > 0,
    DIVIDE (
        CALCULATE (
            COUNTROWS(FILTER ( 'sentiments', 'sentiments'[sentiment] = "neutral" ))
        ),
        COUNTROWS('sentiments')
    )*100,
    0
)

```

### Data Analysis Expression on Crypto Data .
##### Steps:
- In your Semantic Model window, right click on the three dots "..." on your Crypto metric table. i.e. "tbl_cleaned_data"
- From the dropdown, click on "New Measure"
- Then, input the following DAX script for each of the measures and save

3 Days Price Moving Average:

```
4DayMovingAverage = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE([Price]),
    DATESINPERIOD('tbl_cleaned_data'[Date], LASTDATE('tbl_cleaned_data'[Date]), -3, DAY)
)

``` 

Price Change_24h:

```
Price Change 24h = 
VAR PreviousPrice = 
    CALCULATE(
        MAX([Price]),
        DATEADD('tbl_cleaned_data'[Date], -1, DAY)
    )
RETURN
    DIVIDE(
        MAX([Price]) - PreviousPrice,
        PreviousPrice,
        BLANK()
    ) * 100

```

Total Market Cap :

```
Total Market Cap = SUM([Market_Cap])

```

Total Market Cap Dominance:

```
Total Market Cap Dominance = DIVIDE(
    [Total Market Cap],
    CALCULATE(SUM([Market_Cap]), ALL('tbl_cleaned_data')),
    0
) * 100

```
Current Price of Cryptocurrency( Leveraging  slicer has crypto currency)
```
Crypto Price (Dynamic) = 
VAR SelectedCrypto = VALUES( 'tbl_cleaned_data'[name] )
VAR SelectedDate = VALUES( 'tbl_cleaned_data'[Date] )
RETURN
    CALCULATE(
        MAX( tbl_cleaned_data[Price] ),
        FILTER(
            tbl_cleaned_data,
            tbl_cleaned_data[name] IN SelectedCrypto &&
            tbl_cleaned_data[Date] = MAX( tbl_cleaned_data[Date] )
        )
    )

```
Then, close the Semantic Model.
#### PS. This is a live report, but due to Microsoft Power BI Pro license limitations, it's not publicly accessible. However, you can find sample screenshots of each page below.
- Then, go back to your dashboard to build a live report.Using the "Card" visual. Create three "Card" visuals for each of the sentiment measures created.

2a. Create a   Crypto_News table in the report by clicking on the the "table" visual to the top right, under visualization pane, you have an empty table in your canvas.
- Add required fields. First, expand the table by clicking on your table name, say"sentiments" under (Data) Title , to your top right. This reveals in your table as well as the newly created measures for the 
 "sentiment" table.
- Select the following fields/columns (Title, Provider, Url, Snippet, Date) to populate your table.
- Next, Create a Date Slicer by using the slicer visual under "visualisation Pane"
- Format the "Date" slicer to "drop-down" for capturing each date, to make your report organise by date.
- Filter the "News" Table and measures ("Postive sentiment", "Negative Sentiment", "Neutral Sentiment") cards by date, such that the dashboard by default will show the report by current date,with the option to 
  filter the report by previous date.
- Continue formatting your dashboard as deep as your creativity permits.
- Finally, remember to save your work.
*** Images

- 2b. Use the "Line Graph" visuals to visualize the 3 days "Price Moving Average" measure and daily "Price" quotes.
- On the primary "Y-axis" field and secondary "Y-axis" field drag respectively, drag and drop "3 Days Moving Average" measure and "Price" respectively. While on the X-axis field, drag and drop the "date" column.
